Ordinarily, I might have been vexed by such an unsolicited interruption, but the genuine joy radiating from this little fellow (or perhaps, a youthful man, you can never tell with the whimsical races) softened my resolve. Moved by his plight, I decided to welcome him into our fold with a Weanie Wizard patch of unparalleled distinction. After some deft magical work, we shifted our focus back to more pressing matters—namely, my own troubles.</p><p>I recounted the tale of my missing friend, Floon Blagmaar. He had vanished following a night of revelry at the Skewered Dragon, and I had not heard a peep from him since. That was two days ago, and I feared for his safety. Floon is well-regarded, both among the common folk and the upper crust of society. It is this broad exposure that concerns me—inevitably, he would run afoul of trouble, and I feared that time had indeed arrived.</p><p>I offered a reward of ten gold pieces each up front, with an additional hundred gold upon completion of the task. To my astonishment, the brave adventurers declined any payment! They insisted on covering all my expenses from that moment forward. Truly, I had never encountered such noble strangers!</p><p>When they inquired whether I wished to join the search, I was initially hesitant. My talents lie more in the realm book magic than pow pow bang magic. However, they made a compelling point—I was the one who knew Floon best, and they continued to pay for my drinks. So, with my wealth still in my pockets, we set off for the last place I had seen him.</p><p>Our journey was grimly punctuated by a reminder of the underworld’s machinations. A fierce clash between members of the Zentharim and Xanathar’s guild had left the street littered with bodies, while the city watch cleaned up the mess and managed the curious onlookers. Since Floon was not among the fallen, we pressed on with our mission.</p><p>At the Skewered Dragon, Sploosh made a dramatic entrance, bursting through the doors and launching into a song. Alas, the song was one word long &ldquo;ouch&rdquo;, as a Drow at the bar hurled a bottle at him, bruising Sploosh’s spirits and head.</p><p>Dave, incensed on behalf of Sploosh, confronted the Drow. Dave was soon placated as the drow and he shared in their disdain for bagpipes. We then asked the Drow for any information about Floon. Although he recalled the events of that night, he refused to divulge further details, reigniting Dave’s ire. After some light intimidation, we learned that Floon had met another fellow for drinks and gambling, and later left, followed by a group of shady individuals. It seemed the Drow feared these individuals more than he did Dave, and no amount of force would coax more information from him. It was Leaf who suggested employing the most persuasive tool in our arsenal—gold. After parting with some coin, we discovered that this group was known around these parts and frequented a warehouse on Candle Lane.</p><p>Armed with this new lead, the party decided to gather more information about Floon before confronting the enigmatic warehouse workers. We headed to Floon’s home. En route, we stopped by the aftermath of the gang skirmish once more. This time, the adventurers wished to investigate the bodies. Sploosh and Sobek performed a duet, their harmonies enchanting the guards, allowing Leaf to surreptitiously procure keys from one of the deceased and remove Zentharim patches from their uniforms, leaving one to ponder, is it grave robbing if the bodies are not in a grave?</p><p>Floon’s residence was modest—a small 2 story one-bedroom dwelling. Locked as a house should be when you are missing. Dave, thinking with brawn and brain, tossed Leaf through the window, and just like that, we were grave robbers and burglars!</p><p>We ransacked the house with abandon. Sploosh tossed books from the bookshelf, while everyone rummaged through Floon’s belongings. No clue about Floon’s acquaintance from that night emerged. Leaf, having search everything he could at knee high decided to go a different route. Outside he found a rat. &ldquo;Squeak&rdquo; he&mldr;asked? &ldquo;Squeak squeak&rdquo; the rat replied. &ldquo;There is a secret button on the side of the book shelf&rdquo; Leaf informs us. We rushed upstairs, and sure enough, the rat proved accurate. The bookshelf slid away to reveal a safe embedded in the wall.</p><p>We struggled to open the safe, but our efforts were in vain. After some deliberation, Dave declared, &ldquo;I’ve got this,&rdquo; and proceeded to shove Meryl Streep into the safe. Before we could stop him, a sudden snap sounded from within. The safe door slowly creaked open&mldr;</p><p class=author>- The Exemplary Volothamp Geddarm</p></div><div class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://recap.wizardswizardswizards.com/posts/session-1/>Session 1 - They Fight</a></h1><span class=post-date>Jul 21, 2024</span><p>Even in a reputable establishment like the Yawning Portal, a bar fight is scarcely worth the attention when more pressing matters require your focus. My pressing matter, at that moment, lay at the bottom of my mug, where I hoped its contents might dull my concerns. The brawl seemed to involve Yagra Strongfist, a formidable half-orc who earned that surname, squaring off against a handful of humans. These misguided souls appeared to be taking her on one at a time—a bold, yet foolhardy approach, destined to end poorly for them.</p><p>Suddenly, I noticed a lone figure cutting through the crowd, shouting fervently about &ldquo;Jesus Chroist,&rdquo; the deity of Life and Tempest. To my surprise, this zealot intervened, seemingly compelled by some sense of duty against overwhelming odds. In what could not have been more than six seconds, the innkeeper offered a large, ponytailed individual beer in exchange for his aid. Without hesitation, he and his dragonborn companion leaped into the fray. The dragonborn unleashed a torrent of fire upon their foes before launching into a rousing song on his bagpipes that seemed to invigorate his allies.</p><p>As the combatants traded blows, the large one—possessed of remarkable strength—seized one of the humans, his intentions clear: he meant to throw the man into the infamous pit. At that moment, a thought crossed my mind—could these individuals be the solution to my particular predicament? While I pondered, a fourth companion, clearly well-acquainted with the others, rose and, in a brilliant display of magical prowess that could rival even my own, put all but one of the humans to sleep.</p><p>The final human, having narrowly escaped the pit-related demise not once, but thrice, finally recognized the dire turn his fortunes had taken and attempted to flee. The heroes, however, had other plans! They hurled all manner of items—beer bottles, saucers, and more—trying to halt his escape. Finally, the sorcerer threw wind itself, slamming the door shut just as the man reached it. The poor soul ran headlong into the door, knocking himself out cold.</p><p>As the dust settled, the group converged, and it was then that I noticed what bound these eclectic characters together—the noble crests of hotdogs emblazoned on their shoulders. At last, I had found the very sort of adventurers I sought. Yet, as I approached them to extend my offer, someone rudely cut me off, preventing my grand introduction.</p><p class=author>- The Extraordinary Volothamp Geddarm</p></div><div class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://recap.wizardswizardswizards.com/posts/session-0/>Session 0 - They Meat</a></h1><span class=post-date>Jul 11, 2024</span><p>In the City of Splendors, some considered Waterdeep hot dogs the most splendid of the all its splendors. That&rsquo;s why Steve Schelinski felt five feet tall when he heard the news: he had been picked by his firm to work for the Weenie Wizards. Finally, his break into hardcore accounting had arrived. No longer would he handle the books for small businesses or wealthy wizards. He was in the weenie business now, and people everywhere would respect him.</p><p>Then the fire happened, and everyone died. Steve thought that was it; he should join the gnome circus instead. But damnit, he had a fiduciary duty to the survivors to recover any assets they still had. He put out the word that any surviving members should meet him at the Yawning Portal. Steve arrived early to see who would come.</p><p>Right now, there was only a single Weenie Wizard. Judging from his outfit, he seemed a sailor of some sort. Steve had never seen any nautical-related line items on the books, and if he didn&rsquo;t know any better, he might think this man just picked up the Weenie Sigil off the ground and was pretending to be one. Steve chastised himself; the man was mourning. Now was not the time to accuse him of such debauchery.</p><p>Steve spotted another wizard, called Sploosh, if his memory was correct. Sploosh, despite being in a tavern with live music already playing, decided to start performing &ldquo;Sweet Caroline.&rdquo; Steve thought Sploosh must be filled with grief over his dead guild members as he poured his entire soul into the rendition. The entire tavern stopped talking to listen. Sploosh splashed into the chorus with deft skill, the whole bar joining in. As the sea of voices echoed with &ldquo;So good, so good,&rdquo; tears of sadness and joy streamed down everyone&rsquo;s faces. Sploosh was still playing when Steve saw Jesus Chroist walk in.</p><p>Jesus Chroist, formerly a Frankfort Fellow, worked nights in shipping and receiving. Nice guy, though always trying to &ldquo;heal&rdquo; and get them to follow his god, also known as Jesus Chroist. Seemed like a perfectly fine god despite all those murders in his name a thousand years ago. Chroist leaned in for a hug from Sploosh.</p><p>It was hard to miss Dave the Barberarian walking into the tavern. Dave seemed to be a regular at the bar and in moderately good spirits despite his father having just died in a grease fire. Dave was a &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; guild member, his father having held a high rank in the Bun Barons before guild formation. Despite his size, Dave was quite nimble with his two axes, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O&rsquo;Conder. He often cut people&rsquo;s hair with them for a small fee.</p><p>Dave requested &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Ye Stop Believin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and Sploosh obliged. While technically good, you could tell Sploosh didn&rsquo;t put his soul into this one. Most people went back to their drinks. Jesus got up and did a fairly good dance that looked like an artificer&rsquo;s machine but began crying during it.</p><p>Steve approached the group and informed them of the news. They were the only ones left from the fire. All their guild assets had been burned; all that was left were five hot dog carts and the experimental frozen water cart. Dave seemed particularly broken up about the fire, having just realized his father perished in it. Steve informed them that he was paid out until the end of the month and would continue to help them until then.</p><p>Steve was feeling good about himself, successfully transferring the assets of the guild to these four individuals. That was until Sploosh groped him. He could only assume Sploosh was so overcome with grief he didn&rsquo;t know how to compose himself. With that, Steve felt it was his time to leave. Before leaving, Jesus pulled him aside to talk about a business opportunity in textiles. Being a finance guy, Steve got pitched dozens of ideas a week, but something about the way Jesus spoke to him made him believe in his idea. Steve gave him his card.</p><p>While walking out, there seemed to be some commotion in the tavern. It sounded like something for someone else to take care of.</p><p class=author>- Steven Schelinski, Associate Bookkeeper at Gnomewise Financial Solutions</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
