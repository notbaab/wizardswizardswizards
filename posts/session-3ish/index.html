As the safe door creaked open, we sat there, mouths agape at the sight before us. Inside, we found three potions of invisibility and 1,200 Dragons, meticulously arranged in twelve neat piles, along with an additional 200 Dragons haphazardly scattered about. But it was the letters that truly unsettled me. It appeared these Dragons had been obtained through morally questionable means, perhaps by witnessing, or participating in, some rather unsavory dealings.</p><p>My faith in my good friend, however, was restored when we uncovered a note indicating that Floon had been donating a portion of this wealth to the Starlight Sanctuary orphanage. The Weanie Wizards, ever resourceful, quickly decided that the Sanctuary would be our next destination in the search for Floon. And so, we set off toward the orphanage, with the troupe already concocting what I could only describe as an unusual plan for our arrival.</p><p class=author>- The Gentlman Volothamp Geddarm</p><p>At the Sanctuary, we would never turn away a lost soul, and little Pip seemed as lost as ever. He clearly hasn’t bathed in weeks, maybe months. The pirate who came in with him seemed to have neglected any sort of care for the child. Grommuk took to him immediately, which is good, as unfortunately, I don’t see Pip getting adopted anytime soon. The pirate who brought him here, though, lingered for a bit too long. He was inquiring about the finances of the orphanage. It must have been odd to him to see so many repairs going into the dilapidated building, but ever since Floon started giving to the Sanctuary, we’ve been able to put it right into helping the kids.</p><p class=author>- Sister Mariane</p><p>The nerve of those Jesus Freaks. They come to a house of Syreth and to convert us? I&rsquo;m sorry, you want an orphanage run by a god who is responsible for The Purifying Flame, killing all those non believers 800 years ago? And to insinuate that we are taking money from the mouths of our own children? I did not have time for that meaningless distraction today.</p><p class=author>- Sister Elandra</p><p>I hav met new friend today. Pip. He is nice to me. I hav been a orfan so long but now with friend ofanege is much better place I feell like will be friends for long time. I show him bathroom and Sister mariane office. He likd both place alot. He in bathroom for sometime, his number 2 might have turnd number 3. If he take longer than he will miss concert from bag playing man.</p><p class=author>- Grommuk</p><p>I had never considered myself a religious person, but Jesus the human made some great points about Jesus, the God. At the very least, he was convincing enough that I followed him next door for the orphan concert. That was a fantastic idea on my part. Bagpipes are not Kragor&rsquo;s preferred instrument, but when the one they call Sploosh started playing The Vanguard of Gruumsh’s Fury, a battle hym fit for the most glorious of battles, I was right back in my youth. And just like in those days, we started throwing those orphans around the pit. Everyone had a grand time. It could have been the music, the beauty of screaming children, or just the general fear in the air, but Kragor felt his heart grow 10 times that day. I decided right there the one they call Grommuk shall be my son.</p><p class=author>- Kragor Routewarden</p><p>Sister Marianne is a devoted follower, always sacrificing for the children. So, I did find it odd when she asked for my blessing to be passed on to those who put the children in danger in the first place. To be fair, after putting them at such risk, they did manage to save 19 from harm. The pirate was particularly heroic. Anything less than 15 children, and I would not have allowed my blessing to be passed. May their orphan senses serve them well in their pursuit of saving one of my children, Floon.</p><p class=author>- Syreth, Godess of Protection</p><p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; we heard from outside. Someone was approaching. We quickly gestured to hide, thinking we could catch them by surprise. But alas, these individuals were clearly well-trained in combat, and we were no match for them. I pleaded for mercy, appealing to what I hoped was their human side. But as I saw the axe swinging toward my head, I realized they were nothing more than ruthless killers.</p><p class=author>- Plitsch, Kenku Thug</p><p>I sat huddled in the dark closet when some saviors seemed to find me. My heroes, it seems, were looking for Floon, and considering it’s probably my fault he’s missing, I told them everything I knew. The Zhentarim were after me to learn more about the Stone of Golorr, which my father supposedly used to hide the location of his secret stash. My father and I are estranged, but that didn’t seem to matter to them. While I was holed up in this warehouse, the Xanathar Guild attacked the Zhentarim. In the chaos, Floon gave me an invisibility potion he had hidden, and I managed to hide, but the potion wore off before I could escape, leaving me stuck in this broom closet.</p><p>All is not lost, though, for dear Floon. It seems we have a paper bird, and with some clever engineering, we’re going to attempt to follow it after writing Floon a letter. As long as no one interrupts this plan, it should work!</p><p class=author>- Reneer Nevermember</p></div></div></div></body></html>
