How lucky for me that I have five best friends! They are even wizards! Now, I don’t know much about these wizards, but boy, have they had quite a few weeks. It all started with that horrible fire that killed everyone they loved. From there, it seemed they wanted to drown their sorrows in a pub where they met Volothamp Geddarm. He asked them to find his boyfriend, Floon, as he was worried about him.</p><p>It’s impossible for me to know exactly what happened, but the wizards did successfully find Floon. He was hiding underground, captured by the Xanathar Guild, but only after he was captured by the Zhentarim. And after they caused a riot at an orphanage. Renaer Neverember was there too. They found him at a Zhentarim warehouse after they killed a bunch of birds. Renaer suspected that the Zhents and Xants were after him for information about his father’s Stone of Golorr. Captain Hyustus Staget heard that and told them that a “game” was afoot in the underworld. It seems that this stone unlocks some dragons or something, and all the criminal organizations want it. But Renaer was wrong. It turns out Floon knew something about the Cassalanters, and it seems some squid guy wanted that information. It doesn’t matter, though, because my friends saved the day!</p><p>What happened next is hard to say, but Volo gave the wizards a haunted house! The wizards spent most of the money they stole from Floon’s house on the renovations. The house is haunted still but in a happy way now. To celebrate, the wizards went to the opera and met my other best friend, Mirt! For some reason, Mirt always sends people to talk to me instead of talking to me himself. I told them all the things I hear while pulling this cart. I told them about Floxil Ustin staying at the Gralhund Villa, the Doom Fists fighting with the other Zhentarim faction led by Urstul Floxin, and some talk about the Cassalanters’ eyes. Or eye. They have eyes, is what I think they were saying. I know that seems like a safe thing to say about someone, but I’ve met many people without eyes. How do they see? Whenever I meet someone without eyes, I make sure to talk a lot so they know where I am, and they don’t run into me. That would be embarrassing for everyone.</p><p>So anyway, that is all I have to say about the wizards, which brings me to the next part: the explosion in front of their haunted house. There were a lot of dead people. Some street performers, Zhentarim agents, a gnome, and an elderly woman! It turns out the Zhentarim were chasing the gnome when a Nimblewright exploded. Luckily, one of the Zhentarim survived and took something from the gnome. The gnome was Dalakhar, an old worker for Lord Neverember. It turns out he was trying to meet Renaer at Trollskull Alley as he feared for his life. It seems like he was right to fear! The guy got away but seemed like he was hurt. I think the Nimblewright followed him, probably to help him out!</p><p>I’m not too sure what happened after that, but the wizards figured out they should go talk to the artificer guild about the Nimblewrights. Joe and Esmelda of the guild knew the Nimblewright was made by Pere Noel, an artificer that made other artificers look sane. Pere Noel knew who bought the Nimblewrights, but the players had to make some mild threats first. The players broke into the houses of people who owed Mr. Noel money and left them mimics to find in the morning. Turns out the Nimblewright was made for the Cassalanters! I wonder if it&rsquo;s the same Cassalanters that have eyes!</p><p class=author>- Max the Talking Mare</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
