Upon arriving at the scene, Officer Doug recognized the address as a warehouse previously listed as a location of interest. Officer Doug informed me of the disturbance. We responded swiftly, assembling an elite squad to conduct a raid on the warehouse.</p><h2 id=details-of-the-scene class=report><strong>Details of the Scene</strong></h2><p class=report>Following the execution of the raid, six living individuals and twelve deceased were discovered. Among the deceased were three drow, five humans, and four kenku. The bodies had been moved into a pile and appeared to be arranged in preparation for a ritual, which was being conducted by one of the living individuals, identified as Jesus (see below). Initially, the individuals were to be detained; however, upon recognizing their affiliation with the Weenie Wizards Guild, I instructed otherwise. (Note to recorder: Please update Case Number A3951 to reflect new information. Follow-up with the &lsquo;Sole Surviving&rsquo; Weenie Wizard is required.) The individuals posed no immediate threat. The Wizards were questioned and provided details of what occurred during the initial disturbance. According to the individuals, there was an altercation between the Zhentarim and Xanathar&rsquo;s Guild, with the latter searching for an individual, one Floon Blagmaar, who was reportedly present during the initial disturbance. The individual was most likely moved to the sewers and, as such, is no longer a concern for the City Watch. The Weenie Wizards departed at approximately 22:00. Crime scene investigators were summoned shortly afterward and discovered several maps of potential criminal hideouts, which have been filed under evidence numbers E3415 and E5019. The coroner arrived at approximately 23:45 to take possession of the bodies. A ward has been placed on the warehouse that will alert us if any individuals return to the scene of the crime.</p><h2 id=interviewed-party-information class=report><strong>Interviewed Party Information</strong></h2><p class=report><strong>Name:</strong> Sploosh<br><strong>Description:</strong> a dragon born who plays the bagpipes<br><strong>Address:</strong> 1800 Pennsylvania ave<br><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> A bagpipe player with no lips seems far fetched. Unclear why they were lying about it.</p><hr><p class=report><strong>Name:</strong> Leaf<br><strong>Description:</strong> Normal sized for a gnome. A bit dirty. A rat with was riding on his shoulder.<br><strong>Address:</strong> “between places”<br><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Rat had what could only be described as a smug look about him. Rat was not questioned at this time.</p><hr><p class=report><strong>Name:</strong> Sobek<br><strong>Description:</strong> A “sea merchant” with long hair.<br><strong>Address:</strong> a boat on moored on the docks<br><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Definitely a pirate</p><hr><p class=report><strong>Name:</strong> Dave<br><strong>Description:</strong> Large almost barbarous look. Kind eyes<br><strong>Address:</strong> Corner of Park Place and Boardwalk<br><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Didn&rsquo;t talk much, seemed to be dodgering any questions</p><hr><p class=report><strong>Name:</strong> Jesus Chriost<br><strong>Description:</strong> Tatooed and balding human.<br><strong>Address:</strong> In his wagon.<br><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Jesus Chriost is his name, his god, and his religion. Unclear which of the three originated first, though I have significant doubt regarding the sanctity of at least one of them.</p><h2 id=final-analysis class=report><strong>Final Analysis</strong></h2><p class=report>We do not condone vigilantism; however, given our history with the Weenie Wizards and their cooperation, no charges were filed. Of greater concern is the reason behind their friend&rsquo;s capture. It appears that the underworld is pursuing an artifact known as the Stone of Golorr. I fear that another &lsquo;game&rsquo; is unfolding in the underworld (see Case A34115 and B411 for previous instances of the &lsquo;game&rsquo;). I have formally requested funding to double the guard presence in the Southern and Dock Wards.</p><h2 id=follow-up-needed class=report><strong>Follow-Up Needed</strong></h2><p class=report>No follow-up is required at this time; however, I do hope this is not the last encounter with the Weenie Wizards. We still need a caterer for the Winterale party.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
