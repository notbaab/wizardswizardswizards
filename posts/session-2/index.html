Ordinarily, I might have been vexed by such an unsolicited interruption, but the genuine joy radiating from this little fellow (or perhaps, a youthful man, you can never tell with the whimsical races) softened my resolve. Moved by his plight, I decided to welcome him into our fold with a Weanie Wizard patch of unparalleled distinction. After some deft magical work, we shifted our focus back to more pressing matters—namely, my own troubles.</p><p>I recounted the tale of my missing friend, Floon Blagmaar. He had vanished following a night of revelry at the Skewered Dragon, and I had not heard a peep from him since. That was two days ago, and I feared for his safety. Floon is well-regarded, both among the common folk and the upper crust of society. It is this broad exposure that concerns me—inevitably, he would run afoul of trouble, and I feared that time had indeed arrived.</p><p>I offered a reward of ten gold pieces each up front, with an additional hundred gold upon completion of the task. To my astonishment, the brave adventurers declined any payment! They insisted on covering all my expenses from that moment forward. Truly, I had never encountered such noble strangers!</p><p>When they inquired whether I wished to join the search, I was initially hesitant. My talents lie more in the realm book magic than pow pow bang magic. However, they made a compelling point—I was the one who knew Floon best, and they continued to pay for my drinks. So, with my wealth still in my pockets, we set off for the last place I had seen him.</p><p>Our journey was grimly punctuated by a reminder of the underworld’s machinations. A fierce clash between members of the Zentharim and Xanathar’s guild had left the street littered with bodies, while the city watch cleaned up the mess and managed the curious onlookers. Since Floon was not among the fallen, we pressed on with our mission.</p><p>At the Skewered Dragon, Sploosh made a dramatic entrance, bursting through the doors and launching into a song. Alas, the song was one word long &ldquo;ouch&rdquo;, as a Drow at the bar hurled a bottle at him, bruising Sploosh’s spirits and head.</p><p>Dave, incensed on behalf of Sploosh, confronted the Drow. Dave was soon placated as the drow and he shared in their disdain for bagpipes. We then asked the Drow for any information about Floon. Although he recalled the events of that night, he refused to divulge further details, reigniting Dave’s ire. After some light intimidation, we learned that Floon had met another fellow for drinks and gambling, and later left, followed by a group of shady individuals. It seemed the Drow feared these individuals more than he did Dave, and no amount of force would coax more information from him. It was Leaf who suggested employing the most persuasive tool in our arsenal—gold. After parting with some coin, we discovered that this group was known around these parts and frequented a warehouse on Candle Lane.</p><p>Armed with this new lead, the party decided to gather more information about Floon before confronting the enigmatic warehouse workers. We headed to Floon’s home. En route, we stopped by the aftermath of the gang skirmish once more. This time, the adventurers wished to investigate the bodies. Sploosh and Sobek performed a duet, their harmonies enchanting the guards, allowing Leaf to surreptitiously procure keys from one of the deceased and remove Zentharim patches from their uniforms, leaving one to ponder, is it grave robbing if the bodies are not in a grave?</p><p>Floon’s residence was modest—a small 2 story one-bedroom dwelling. Locked as a house should be when you are missing. Dave, thinking with brawn and brain, tossed Leaf through the window, and just like that, we were grave robbers and burglars!</p><p>We ransacked the house with abandon. Sploosh tossed books from the bookshelf, while everyone rummaged through Floon’s belongings. No clue about Floon’s acquaintance from that night emerged. Leaf, having search everything he could at knee high decided to go a different route. Outside he found a rat. &ldquo;Squeak&rdquo; he&mldr;asked? &ldquo;Squeak squeak&rdquo; the rat replied. &ldquo;There is a secret button on the side of the book shelf&rdquo; Leaf informs us. We rushed upstairs, and sure enough, the rat proved accurate. The bookshelf slid away to reveal a safe embedded in the wall.</p><p>We struggled to open the safe, but our efforts were in vain. After some deliberation, Dave declared, &ldquo;I’ve got this,&rdquo; and proceeded to shove Meryl Streep into the safe. Before we could stop him, a sudden snap sounded from within. The safe door slowly creaked open&mldr;</p></div></div></div></body></html>
